# Hi!

This is a quick introduction on how to navigate this test suite and results that I've created.

# Suite_Explained.pdf 
Explains in details all the tests created for this task (Manual/Automated), why they are failing and they are all followed by a simple example of how I would write them to the engineers. They all include images of the automated test itself and the result.

# \Automation_Testing_Suite\
Provides the .\Automation_Suite\ in two formats: Python and SeleniumIDE.
While the Python ones use pytest. It's possible to open them check the tests that I've made.

# \Automation_Testing_Results_Images\
Provides the images used in Suite_Explained.pdf for the Automation Tests itself and their results for better viewing.

# \Manual_Tests_Pictures\
As the name says, are the screenshots for the manual tests provided in Suite_Explained.pdf in better detail.
